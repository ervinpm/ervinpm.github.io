To list out the shares in a host use the `smbclient` program

## List shares
```sh
$ smbclient -L host
```

If you get a `lp_load_ex: Max protocol NT1 is less than min protocol SMB2_02.` 
error, add the following entries to your `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file.

```conf
client min protocol = SMB2
client max protocol = SMB3
```

Restart after adding the two entries

```
$ sudo systemctl restart smb
```
