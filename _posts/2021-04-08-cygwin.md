When you are stuck with windows and want to install a linux shell, you can install cygwin to have that unix feel :)

## Install Cygwin

1. Head over to <https://cygwin.com/install.html> and install the version for your system
2. Install apt-cyg for easy package management:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg
$ install apt-cyg /bin
$ apt-cyg install zsh git gdb dos2unix openssh vim
```
3. Update the home folder to your user folder by updating `c:/cygwin64/etc/nsswitch.conf`. Add this line: `db_home: windows`

## Install Cmder

1. Head over to <https://cmder.net/> and install the full version
2. Download and install the recommended fonts from here: https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k
3. Open cmder and and head over to the settings.
4. Add a new task under `Startup > Tasks` by clicking on the `+` button.
5. Under Task parameters, set an icon: `-icon "C:\cygwin64\Cygwin.ico"`
6. In the commands specify to start with zsh: `C:\cygwin64\bin\mintty.exe /usr/bin/zsh --login -i -new_console:d:%USERPROFILE%`

## Install PowerLevel10k!

1. Clone the p10k repository to your home folder and update the `.zshrc` file
```sh
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k
$ echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc
```
2. Restart cmder and follow the wizard
3. If the configuration wizard does not start automatically, use the `p10k configure` command
4. Enjoy!
