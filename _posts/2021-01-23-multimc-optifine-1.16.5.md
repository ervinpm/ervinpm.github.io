I really wanted to install Optifine for Minecraft 1.16.5 and  can't wait for the official release. These are the steps to install:

1. Create new instance with Minecraft Version 1.16.5
2. Install Fabric (Button locaated in the right hand side)
3. Download Fabric API (Not sure if this is needed but I installed it anyway). You can find them [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files). 
4. In the loader mods, add the downloaded fabric api jar file.
5. Download Optifine from [here](https://optifine.net/downloads).
6. Add it to the loader mods, the same as fabric api
7. Download the custom optifabric [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmP3nCfHzngKv73mt84FxgPjCchuNoMoYj6yYaZSGRseQr/optifabric-1.8.16.jar). If you're curious on what was changed, you can find the updated repository [here](https://github.com/ervinpm/OptiFabric).
8. Add the custom jar to the loader mod.
9. And you're done! Launch the game
