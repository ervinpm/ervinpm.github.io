<h2 id="installing-cert-manager">Installing cert manager</h2>
<p>Here is the yaml to install cert manager:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>kubectl apply <span class="nt">-f</span> https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.2.0/cert-manager.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="testing-the-installation">Testing the installation</h2>
<p>To test if it worked, use a self signed certificate</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>kubectl apply <span class="nt">-f</span> test-resources.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that, you can confirm by describing the created resources:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>kubectl describe certificate <span class="nt">-n</span> cert-manager-test
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should have something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Spec:
  Common Name:  me.com
  Issuer Ref:
    Name:       test-selfsigned

    Reason:                Ready

    Type:                  Ready

  ----    ------      ----  ----          -------

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that, you may cleanup the test resources</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>kubectl delete <span class="nt">-f</span> test-resources.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="installing-letsencrypt">Installing letsencrypt</h3>
